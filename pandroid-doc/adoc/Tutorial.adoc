Pandroid v{pandroidVersion}, {generationDate}

== Basics


=== Architecture

One of the main goals of Pandroid archetype is to help you organise your project and share a common vision/architecture with other developers. +
"Why bother ? Because I understand my code and I work faster like that."
True, but I'm sure you had to make a changes on an application of another developer and it looked like a mess. Yet it was a piece of art for him.
What a waste of time to refactor the code of the others because you just don't understand it. Neither share the same practices...
Most of the time all of that is just a matter of perspective. With Pandroid we try to share the same vision and understand each others much more faster.


To illustrate this lets take a look at this schema:



[[bad_architecture]]
.Frequent bad architecture
image::{assetsDir}archi/bad_archi.png[Bad architecture,652,262,align="center"]


In most applications, when nothing is done to organize the code, it could look like this.
Libraries are used in a lot of classes. We don't know which classes are used to run a functionality or another.
If I am asked to change my application structure, I could be in a big trouble because all of my screens which are linked to each others : I would have to extract my functionalities from my UI. And if I need to change a library for another one... I'm just screwed.


In order to resolve all of these issues, Pandroid proposes a modular architecture


[[good_architecture]]
.Pandroid modular architecture
image::{assetsDir}archi/good_archi.png[Bad architecture,652,330,align="center"]

With this architecture, none of my screens knows another. They send and listen events in order to work together.
A responsive UI isn't an issue anymore !
It is quite easy to replace a library, component or anything by another without impacting all our screens because libraries are hidden behind an abstract manager interface.
I can identify which part of the code is responsible of a functionality and thus it's really easy to test it.


=== Dagger

To perform our library abstraction and deal with all of our managers, Pandroid uses Dagger 2 which is a powerful Dependencies Injection Library.

TIP: The official documentation is available http://google.github.io/dagger[here].

=== Event Bus

Pandroid uses a EventBusManager to share informations between screens. The main idea is to avoid screens
interdependencies. Activities and fragments stay independents in order to be more flexible with UI changes.

Pandroid offers a simple and powerful implementation of EventBusManager. This implementation works with
a gradle plugin which generates code and simplifies your life.

Let's see how it works:

*Send a simple Object*

[source,java]

include::{demoJava}main/event/EventFragment.java[tags=sendSimpleEvent]
----

*Send a simple Object*

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}main/event/EventFragment.java[tags=sendTaggedEvent]

include::{demoJava}main/event/EventSecondFragment.java[tags=sendTaggedEvent]

----

*Delivery policy*

[source,java]
----
include::{javaJava}event/EventBusManager.java[tags=deliveryPolicy]

----


TIP: link::{demoJava}main/event/EventFragment.java[This example] is available in the link::{demoDir}[demo project]





== Panda style

NOTE: This part is about the Pandroid pattern and some of the core functionalities.

=== Plugin configuration

To avoid expansive compilation or multidex issues, Pandroid has some optional libraries that you will have
to configure before any usage. If you forget to specify the optional library, you will get an error displaying "no class found exception"


To add the needed dependencies you have to declare it in the pandroid extension of your project

[source,java]
----
pandroid{
    library('libName') { //Regex matching declared configurator will bring the dependency
        manifestConfig 'param1', 'param2', 'param3'  //needed configuration in manifest
    }
}
----

The plugin is using configurators in order to extract the librairies' configurations from Pandroid, the plugin is using configurators.
It allows you to modify the gradle's configuration and the manifest of your app when the plugin is applied.

To see default configurators, take a look at this link::../../{libDir}pandroid.gradle[pandroid.gradle].

Here is an example:
[source,java]
----
pandroid{
    configurators{
        'name.of.my.lib' {
            gradle {
            //This part will be applyed on your build.gradle
                dependencies {
                   compile ('name.of.my.lib:version')
                }
            manifest {
            //This part will be merged to your manifest
                    params ->
                        '''
        <application>
            <meta-data
                android:name="my.lib.ApiKey"
                android:value="''' + params[0] + '''" />
        </application>
    '''
    }
}
----

WARNING: Some of the libraries need plugins in order to work (Analytics, Crashlytics, ...).
You will have to configure the plugin classpath by yourself because pandroid can't resolve it

TIP: All configuration files applied to your project can be found in the pandroid folder in your build folder


=== PandroidApplication

Your application has to extend PandroidApplication in order to:

* Initialize PandroidConfig with the app's BuildConfig. This class allows the library to know if your app
is in DEBUG mode. (To enable Logger for example)

WARNING: If your application changes his package name for some flavors, you have to override the _getBuildConfig()_ method
in order to give the good BuildConfig class

* Initialize the logger. See link:#_logger[Logger part] to know how to customize it.

* Handle Dagger component injection. Pandroid classes will inject their manager using the PandroidApplication.
You can give a custom base component by overriding _createBaseComponent()_

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}/DemoApplication.java[tags=createBaseComponent]
----

=== PandroidModule/Component

To work properly, PandroidActivity/PandroidFragment needs managers created by the BaseComponent. That is why PandroidApplication provides this BaseComponent. To simplify your life, your
Application Component can extend the BaseComponent in order to be injected automatically in every PandroidActivity/PandroidFragment. The PandroidModule needed by this base component provides the context, a logger, the EventBus and an initialized OkHttpClient.Builder.


=== PandroidActivity

PandroidActivity is the base activity you should extend in a Pandroid application.
This activity handles the following points :

- Dagger injection & LifecycleDelegate initialization

[source,java]
----
include::{libJava}/app/PandroidActivity.java[tags=PandroidActivityInjection]
----

- onResume Helper

[source,java]
----
include::{libJava}/app/PandroidActivity.java[tags=PandroidActivityResume]
----

- Back pressed behavior

[source,java]
----
include::{libJava}/app/PandroidActivity.java[tags=PandroidActivityBack]
----

- Provides a receiver that will be attached/detached from your application by the EventBusLifeCycleDelegate

[source,java]
----
include::{libJava}/app/PandroidActivity.java[tags=PandroidActivityReceivers]
----

=== PandroidFragment

PandroidFragment is the base fragment you should extend in a Pandroid application.
This Fragment handles the same points than a PandroidActivity.

==== Open Fragment

To open a fragment, you are encouraged to use the event bus. All you have to do is to send a FragmentOpener event
and... that's it ! A custom event receiver named FragmentEventReceiver will handle the new fragment for you.

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}/main/MainActivity.java[tags=FragmentReceivers]
----

==== Fragment arguments

If you use FragmentEventReceiver to open your fragment, you are already giving arguments to your fragment. In fact, when
you use _startFragment(...)_, the method will create a FragmentOpener which has two jobs :

- It will be used to filter
 the event and find the right receiver

- It is in charge of building your fragment instance.

By building a custom FragmentOpener, you will be able to send parameters to your fragment.
 If your opener is parcelable it will be saved as parcelable to the fragment, otherwise, it will be serialized.

To sum up here is an example:

- Send an event

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}main/anim/AnimationFragment.java[tags=FragmentWithOpener]
----

- FragmentOpener

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}main/anim/MaterialOpener.java[tags=FragmentWithOpener]
----

- Manage an event (MainActivity.java)

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}main/MainActivity.java[tags=FragmentWithOpener]
----

- Get arguments

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}main/anim/MaterialFragment.java[tags=FragmentWithOpener]
----

=== Lifecycle Delegate

Lifecycle delegates are listeners that are following the lifecycle of an activity or a fragment.
They are handled by the PandroidDelegate you find in a PandroidActivity/Fragment.
They are used to extract and share behaviors without any heritage.

To understand what we could do with them take a look at this example


[source,java]
----
include::{libJava}app/delegate/impl/IcepickLifecycleDelegate.java[tags=LifecycleDelegate]
----

By default PandroidLifecycleDelegate is create in your PandroidApplication.

[source,java]
----
include::{libJava}/PandroidApplication.java[tags=PandroidBaseLifecycleDelegate]
----
NOTE: you could override this method to bring new behavior to all activity and fragment.


=== Logger

A powerful logger is a very important part of your development. A logger can become your best friend to identify bugs remotely.
But keep in mind that your logger has to be properly configured to avoid any security vulnerability or debugging mess.

To help you with that, Pandroid proposes a PandroidLogger that you can get by singleton but that you are encouraged
 to inject with the BaseComponent of your PandroidApplication to get more flexibility.
This Logger is a LogWrapper which means it can wrap any logger you need.
In your PandroidApplication, the LogcatLogger is added by default to your loggerWrapper.


[source,java]
----
include::{libJava}PandroidApplication.java[tags=Logger]
----

==== Crashlytics

Crashlytics is an optional library in pandroid.

.Installation

- build.gradle

[source,java]
----
include::{libDir}pandroid.gradle[tags=Crashlytics]

pandroid
{
    dependencies{
        library ("crashlytics"){
            manifestConfig "YOUR_CRASHLYTICS_API_KEY"
        }
    }
}

----

- add the CrashlyticsLogger to the logWrapper

[source,java]
----
// this logger is configured to be activated when the BuildConfig.DEBUG is false
// you can override this behaviour
logWrapper.addLogger(new CrashlyticsLogger(this));
----


== Security

=== Proguard

Pandroid helps you to use Proguard. The Pandroid plugin brings the pandroid-proguard-rules.pro in the pandroid build folder.
By default, the Android plugin is configured to use this file

[source,groovy]
----
include::{libDir}pandroid.gradle[tags=Proguard]
----

WARNING: Make sure that your application does not overwrite the proguard's configuration

=== Encryption Manager

To help you encrypt critical data, Pandroid provides a CryptoManager implementation: RsaAesCryptoManager. This manager provides two ways to encrypt/decrypt datas: symmetric using AES and asymmetric using RSA.

WARNING: None of these encryption methods are unbreakable. Keep in mind that the best way to keep data safe on the phone is probably not to keep them.

=== Secure Key

Pandroid extension provide tools to encrypt your critical keys. This encryption is based on the app signing configuration. Make sure your application is properly configure.

- to encrypt your key

[source,java]
----
pandroid{
    productFlavors{
        all{
            secureField "YOUR_KEY_NAME", "YOUR_KEY"
        }
        prod {
            secureField "YOUR_KEY_NAME", "YOUR_PROD_KEY"
        }
    }
}
----

- to decrypt your key

[source,java]
----

//your secure field will be add to BuildConfig with the prefix SECURE_
String decryptKey = PandroidConfig.getSecureField(context, BuildConfig.SECURE_YOUR_KEY_NAME)
//...

----


== Network

=== TrustManager / KeyManager

If you need to add custom TrustManager or KeyManager, you can override the PandroidModule methods in your application Class.

An example is available in DemoApplication.

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}DemoApplication.java[tags=certificat]
----

=== Delegate

To perform async calls, Pandroid provides a generic delegate that you can use.
[source,java]
----
include::{libJava}future/ActionDelegate.java[]
----

To help you avoid errors during a view update once your activity or fragment has been released, Pandroid provides
CancellableActionDelegate and NetActionDelegate. Those classes have the ability to be cancelled to ignore the async result.
These delegates can be registered to your PandroidActivity/PandroidFragment in order to be cancelled automatically during the onPause.

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}main/rest/RestFragment.java[tags=Retrofit]
----
=== Retrofit

Pandroid provides the Retrofit library.
Retrofit is a library used to perform REST webservice requests in a simple way.

TIP: See http://square.github.io/retrofit/[official documentation] to use Retrofit

.You can initialize your service with the provided client builder.

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}DemoModule.java[tags=Retrofit]
----

.PandroidCall allows you to use Pandroid ActionDelegate.

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}globals/review/ReviewManagerImpl.java[tags=Retrofit]
----



==== Mock

If your service uses the PandroidCallAdapterFactory, you can use the Mock annotation to simulate network calls.
The mock has to be enabled during the declaration of your PandroidCallAdapterFactory.

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}globals/review/ReviewService.java[tags=Retrofit]
----
=== Picture

Pandroid provides a PictureManager to help you extract your image library from your code.
PictureManager allows you to associate an image (with its URL) to an ImageView
Options are available such as adding a placeholder image or a delegate method (listener) to perform processing when loading the image.

==== Glide

Glide is an optional library. To use it you need to add the dependency to the Pandroid dependencies in your build.gradle file.


.Installation

- Build.gradle

[source,java]
----
pandroid{
    dependencies{
        library 'glide'
    }
}
----

- Module

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}/DemoModule.java[tags=Glide]
----

- Inject it

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}main/rest/RestFragment.java[tags=Glide]
----


== User interface

=== Animation

[source,java]
----
include::{javaJava}event/EventBusManager.java[tags=deliveryPolicy]
----

All these animations can be found in the Pandroid Demo under the animation section. They will be described in their apparition order while running the application.

==== ResizeView

The simplest method to perform a resize animation on an element. You just call the method with the targeted View as one of the arguments, along with the new size and animation duration.

[source,java]
----
ResizeAnimation.create(resizeView).height( X ).width( Y ).duration( T ).startAnimation();
----

==== RotateView

This method works in a similar way that ResizeView and allows to perform a 3D rotation on an object, like flipping a coin.

[source,java]
----
Rotate3dAnimation rotate3dAnimation = new Rotate3dAnimation(180, 360, Rotate3dAnimation.CENTER.CENTER,
        DeviceUtils.dpToPx(getActivity(), 100), false);
rotate3dAnimation.setRotationAxis(Rotate3dAnimation.AXIS.Y);
rotate3dAnimation.setDuration(1000);
rotateView.startAnimation(rotate3dAnimation);
----

==== Material Framgent

This one might be the most interesting animation in the demo, because used in another way. It allows to use a semi-automatic animation between 2 different Views (that could be in different screens ?).
To do this we have to provide in an Opener the required arguments, from an ImageView for example, like sizing or position...

[source,java]
----
ViewInfosContainer ivInfos = new ViewInfosContainer(ivMaterial, view);
ViewInfosContainer tvInfos = new ViewInfosContainer(tvTitle, view);
sendEvent(new MaterialOpener(ivInfos, tvInfos));
----

Material fragment will be in charge of fetching the position of the first view and create an animation to transition with the second one.

[source,java]
----
materialTransitionLayout.addAnimation(mOpener.ivInfos, R.id.material_iv);
materialTransitionLayout.addAnimation(mOpener.tvInfos, R.id.material_tv);
materialTransitionLayout.setRevealCenter(R.id.material_iv); //Optional Method
materialTransitionLayout.open();
----

==== CircularFrameLayout

This animation, last in the Pandroid  demo allows to display all the objects and create an animation that finishes on a single visible object.
In order to do this, we only have to set the same listener to our 4 Buttons:

[source,java]
----
view.findViewById(R.id.animation_test_btn).setOnClickListener(circularClickListener);
----

Then update the listener to provide the animation to perform.
Puis de modifier notre listener pour lui donner l'animation à réaliser.
 As shown here, test if the base object is the single one displayed, then perform the animation to make the others visible.
 Or chose the selected button as the center and perform the animation again.

[source,java]
----
if (circularFrameLayout.isClipOutEnable()) {
    circularFrameLayout.open(animatorListener);
} else {
    circularFrameLayout.setCenter(v.getX() + v.getWidth() / 2, v.getY() + v.getHeight() / 2);
    circularFrameLayout.animateToRadius(v.getWidth(), getResources().getInteger(R.integer.anim_speed), animatorListener);
}
----

=== List


Pandroid provides an adapter for ListView and RecyclerView.
Both of them have the same pattern : you have to provide a HolderFactory and your adapter is responsible of the data list.
These adapters help you with items gestures and animations
See demo's examples

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}/main/list/RecyclerViewFragment.java[tags=RecyclerViewAdapter]
----

A easiest implementation is available for simple RecyclerView

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}/main/list/SimpleRecyclerViewFragment.java[tags=SimpleRecyclerViewAdapter]
----

=== List header

A view is available to have a QuickHeader. This header can be used with ListView ScrollView and RecyclerView.
See ListViewFragment in the demo

[source,xml]
----
include::{demoRes}/layout/fragment_listview.xml[tags=QuickHeaderLayout]
----

=== Toast

Pandroid allows you to customize Android Toast notifications thanks to a dedicated ToastManager. With this manager, you can change the style of your toasts by choosing among 3 styles :

[source,xml]
----
include::{libRes}/values/styles.xml[tags=Toast]
----

If needed, you can declare your own style.

You can also add a ToastListener to know when the toast is dismissed or clicked.

It's possible to make a more advanced toast by adding an image, a button, or even a loader to it.

==== Supertoast
Supertoast is optional, to use it you need to add the dependency to the Pandroid dependencies in your module build.gradle file :

.Installation

- build.gradle

[source,java]
----
pandroid{
    dependencies {
        library "supertoast"
    }
}
----

You can inject the manager with dagger to use it in your classes, don't forget to provide it in your app module class :

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}DemoModule.java[tags=provideToastManager]
----

The ToastManager interface exposes a list of methods to display toasts, here is an example of a simple error styled toast :

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}/main/rest/RestFragment.java[tags=toastUsageExample]
----


=== Scanner

==== Vision

Vision is an optional Google Play Services library. You will have to declare it in the Pandroid extension.
Pandroid provides a PandroidScannerView to integrate the library

TIP: The official documentation is available https://developers.google.com/vision/[here].

.Installation

- build.gradle

[source,java]
----
pandroid{
    dependencies {
        library "vision"
    }
}
----

- usage (ScannerFragment.java)

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}/main/scanner/ScannerFragment.java[tags=Vision]
----


=== Custom Views

.ProgressWheel

A custom Lollipop loader is available to create beautiful loading screens.


== Storage

=== Preferences

To store preferences, a ConfigurationManager is available to abstract any storage library.

.SharedPrefConfigurationManager

This implementation of ConfigurationManager uses Android SharePreferences to store your object. If needed,
the manager can serialize your object to string with GSON.

=== Loader

To process heavy async tasks, you should use Android Loader instead of AsyncTask. You can find the documentation link::http://developer.android.com/guide/components/loaders.html[here]
To help you doing so, Pandroid provides a SimpleAsyncTaskLoader.

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}/main/rest/RestFragment.java[tags=Loader]
----

== Analytics

=== Google Analytics

Google Analytics is an optional library.

.Installation

You need to add the dependency in your build.gradle

[source,java]
----

include::{libDir}/pandroid.gradle[tags=GoogleAnalytics]

pandroid {
    dependencies {
        library 'play-services-analytics'
    }
}
----

Finally, in your module, you can provided Analytics Manager and configure your tracker.

[source,java]
----
include::{demoJava}DemoModule.java[tags=provideAnalyticsManager]
----

=== Firebase Analytics

Firebase Analytics is an optional library.

.Installation

You need to add the dependency in your build.gradle
[source,java]
----

include::{libDir}/pandroid.gradle[tags=FirebaseAnalytics]

pandroid {
    dependencies {
        library 'firebase-analytics'
    }
}
----

WARNING: GMS services now require a *google-services.json* configuration file. Please refer to the official documentation
It can be generated here : https://developers.google.com/mobile/add
