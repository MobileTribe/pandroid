## Note

Pandroid is a mobile archetype used for Android projects. It suggest a architecture for your mobile app and help you handle common problematic you meet in Android development.

To discover what the panda can do, please see the link:./pandroid-doc/html/Tutorial.html[tutorial part] of this wiki.


This library was originaly used by Leroy Merlin France mobile teams to develop all their Android applications.
In february 2015 Pandroid 1 was release for LM internal team. A year later the archetype needed a major refactor to improv the developer experiences. We decided to release and open Pandroid 2
