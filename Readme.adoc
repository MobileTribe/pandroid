## Note

Pandroid is a mobile archetype used for Android projects. It suggest an architecture for your mobile app and help you handle common problematic you meet in Android development.

To discover what the panda can do, please see the link:{htmlPath}pandroid-doc/html/Tutorial.html[tutorial part] of this wiki.


This library was originaly used by Leroy Merlin France mobile teams to develop all their Android applications.
In february 2015 Pandroid 1 was release for LM internal team. A year later the archetype needed a major refactor to improv the developer experiences. We decided to release and open Pandroid 2
A presentation is available about the road we traveled : https://prezi.com/xyuwjyycsbsh/mobile-archetype-pandroid-2/
